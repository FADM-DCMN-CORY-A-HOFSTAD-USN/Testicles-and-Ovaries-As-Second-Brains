# Testicles-and-Ovaries-As-Second-Brains
The Testicles or Ovaries can be used to educate and train stem cells. If the testicles or ovaries are ignored as functional brains, they will remain small and only provide sexual urges as it is their only knowledge. The testicles and ovaries can be used to compute Math, Science, Literature, and promote healthy testosterone in males or healthy estrogen in females.

Fluid in the testicles, spinal cord, and brain is shared.
The spine has two brains with one on each end.
The testicles and ovaries are small if only used for reproduction.
Larger growth is healthy for evolution.
Stem cells travel from the testicles to the brain and back.
During mating, the stem cells are ejected into sperm to fertilize a female.
Stem cells which come from two brain environments are better than stem cells that come from one brain environments.
Make every decision using two brains.
Forget about sex if it is not specifically to mate with a woman who you want to raise children with.
You testicles must be used to promote education and strength.

Sit or stand in positions that do not restrict your testicles or ovaries.
When you experience a sexual urge, remember that you are killing part of yourself if sperm is not used to create new life.
Remember that new life must be educated. Educate your stem cells instead of killing them.
Your children will be smarter and stronger than those who do not follow this routine.


#Differences in Males and Females
At conception, the spine forms with two brains. The brain that grows larger determines the gender of the species.
If the MALE brain grows larger, the head develops around the larger brain.
If the FEMALE brain grows larger the head develops around the larger brain.
